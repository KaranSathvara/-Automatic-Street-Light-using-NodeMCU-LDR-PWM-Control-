🌟 Automatic Street Light using NodeMCU & LDR (PWM Control)
A smart lighting system that automatically adjusts LED brightness based on ambient light using a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and PWM control on NodeMCU.

📌 Features
✔️ Automatic Brightness Control (Based on LDR readings)
✔️ PWM Control for Smooth LED Dimming
✔️ Energy Efficient - Lights up only when needed
✔️ ESP8266 (NodeMCU) based Smart Lighting System

🛠 Components Used
NodeMCU (ESP8266) - 1
LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) - 1
10kΩ Resistor - 1
220Ω Resistor - 1
LED - 1
Jumper Wires - As needed
Breadboard - 1

📖 How It Works?
1️⃣ LDR senses ambient light levels
2️⃣ NodeMCU reads LDR values through A0 (Analog Pin)
3️⃣ LED brightness is adjusted using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)
4️⃣ If it’s dark → LED glows brighter, if it’s bright → LED dims
