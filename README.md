### **🚦 Automatic Street Light using NodeMCU & LDR**  

#### **🔍 Overview**  
This project demonstrates an **Automatic Street Light System** using **NodeMCU (ESP8266) and an LDR sensor**. The system **automatically adjusts the brightness of an LED** based on ambient light intensity using **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)**.  

#### **⚡ Key Features**  
✅ **LDR-based Light Sensing** – Detects surrounding light levels  
✅ **PWM Control for Smooth Brightness Adjustment**  
✅ **Low Power Consumption & Smart Automation**  
✅ **NodeMCU (ESP8266) for Efficient Processing**  

#### **🛠 How It Works?**  
1️⃣ **LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)** continuously measures ambient light intensity.  
2️⃣ **NodeMCU reads LDR values** from the A0 pin and processes the data.  
3️⃣ **PWM Signal controls LED brightness**:  
   - **Bright light → LED dims**  
   - **Dark environment → LED glows brighter**  
4️⃣ **Smooth transition between brightness levels ensures power efficiency!**

#### **📌 Applications**  
🔹 Smart street lighting systems  
🔹 Home automation projects  
🔹 Energy-saving solutions
